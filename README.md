# BettyLabs Backend Engineer Takehome
---------

**The purpose of this exercise is to give you a practical test of your ability to write some endpoints that are similar to our demands in production**

**The project should take around 3-4 hours, please let us know if you have concerns about the timeframe**

## **So hereâ€™s the outline for the exercise:**
- We would like you to build a content system, similar to Reddit.
- Features include:
  - All requests will have a `username` (we aren't going to bother with auth in this exercise)
  - Create a text post, with a `createdBy` field
  - Support upvoting/downvoting a `score` on a post. An individual `username` can only vote once per post
  - Provide a "Feed", that returns 5 "Hot" posts, using at least `score` and age to determine what posts are hot
- We have a Postgres database hosted for you, at:
`postgres://xtxusdhnrrmdac:95ddcbbdb7c445a8cbde57b703e459eb6e8bfc49e034bd82507a938b327b0bcb@ec2-184-72-236-3.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d1st28o90pimq0`

## **Criteria:**
1) Development Speed
2) Maintainability
  - Modular
  - Readability
3) Performant

## **Output:**
- A code repository, including `/.git`, zipped
- A list of features you would add to this project if you had more time, as well as any improvements you could make (if applicable)
- Please email your submission to `matt@bettylabs.io`
